  Here is the **final professional `README.md`** for your **GitHub project**, focusing on **ThingSpeak integration and website visualization**.

# **🌐 Web-Based EMG Signal Visualization**  

## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project focuses on processing **EMG signals** and visualizing them on a **custom website** using data from **ThingSpeak IoT**. Since **ThingSpeak private channels require a subscription for public access**, we implemented a **backend API** to fetch and display the data seamlessly.  
The goal is to process, analyze, and visualize EMG signals in both time and frequency domains while making the website **more advanced with oscilloscope-like features**.

## **🌍 Software Setup: Connecting ThingSpeak to Website**  

### **1️⃣ Step 1: Set Up ThingSpeak Channel**  
1. **Sign up** on [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) and create a new **channel**.  
2. Add **Field 1** for **Time-Domain Data** and **Field 2** for **Frequency-Domain Data**.  
3. Go to **API Keys** and copy your **Read API Key**.  

### **2️⃣ Step 2: ESP32 Data Upload to ThingSpeak**  
- ESP32 sends **EMG data** to ThingSpeak via HTTP POST requests.  
- The data includes **filtered EMG signals** in **time and frequency domains**.

### **3️⃣ Step 3: View Data on Custom Website**  
Once the **ESP32 successfully uploads EMG signals** to ThingSpeak, the **custom website fetches the data in real-time** and displays:  

✅ **Time-Domain Graph**  
✅ **FFT-Based Frequency-Domain Graph**  
✅ **User-Friendly EMG Signal Visualization**  

**🔗 Access the Website Here:**

## **📢 How It Works**
1️⃣ ESP32 **sends EMG data** to ThingSpeak.  
2️⃣ ThingSpeak **stores the data** in private channels.  
3️⃣ The website **fetches data using the API**.  
4️⃣ The data is **displayed in real-time** for analysis.

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**   
🔹 Optimize **backend API for low-latency data fetching**.  
🔹 Oscilloscope-Like Features: Improve the website by integrating zoom, pan, and cursor tracking to analyze signals better.
🔹 Real-Time Annotations: Implement an AI-based feature to detect abnormalities and highlight signal variations.
